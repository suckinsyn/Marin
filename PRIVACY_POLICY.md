Last updated: 2025-05-11

This bot ("the Service") respects your privacy and is designed to minimize data collection.

## Data Collected

## How We Use Your Data

- Messages sent to the AI service are used solely for automated moderation decisions and are not stored by this bot.

## Data Storage and Retention

- No user data is stored permanently beyond the configured server/channel IDs.
- Messages are not stored after processing and are only relayed for AI moderation.
- Logs may be retained temporarily for debugging if explicitly enabled by the bot owner.

## Data Sharing

- No data is sold or shared with third parties outside of this AI processing.
